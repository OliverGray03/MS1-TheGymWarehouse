# Structure 

## Features

This website is divided into three pages. A home page, a classes page and a contact page. Each page follows the basic structure of a responsive nav bar, hero image, a map and a footer with links to the business social media accounts. 

# Home Page 
The home page gives is split into four main sections. The first being "About us" along with a hero and second image. This section is desinged to give new users a brief insight into the business and leave them wanting to explore more of the website. The second section details the facilities, services and type of membership the gym has to offer. This is designed with new users and potential customers in mind looking for clear and easy to read bullet points on what the gym can offer. Beneath this is a section with details and customer friednly images of the personal trainers who work for the gym and will lead any classes. This section is designed for both new and existing users to gain insight into the speciality each trainer offers. Finally the last section is an incentive to potential new customers, a free three day pass. This section is targeted at drawing in potential new customers, once they are in the gym staff members can discuss memberships and other sales opportunities. 

# Classes page 
The classes page is split into two sections, an informative piece on the classes run in the gym and a sign up form for these classes. The timetable details which classes are held on which day at specific times, this is designed to give new users an insight into the variety of classes offered by the gym and existing members a reminder of which classes they wish to attend. The timetable can be viewed in full on laptop and has a scroll bar on both tablet and mobile devices, so the user is not affected by screen size. The second section is a form with a dropdown option which enables the user to book a class on their device without having to book whislt at the gym. This form has been desinged with data validation to ensure the user enters all their details and a success message when all the details have been sent correctly, letting the user know a confirmation email will be sent.

# Contact page 
The contact page is split into two sections, a feedback form and specific contact details. The contact form is designed for both new and existing users to ask any unanswered questions they may have that hasnt been detailed on the website. It also give the user a chance to leave feedback on the layout and details of the website or the gym itself. The second section details specific contact details like, address, phone number and email address for the user to contact the gym directly should they need any further information. 

# Existing Features 
- The gym name is feature on each page at the top left of the screen in the nav bar. Its function is to build and promote brand awareness and thereofre, is styled consistantly accross all three pages. As a secondary function the brand name can be used as a clickable link to direct back to the homepage, this is apparent when hovering over the name as the color changes on a cursor hover. 
- The navigation links are styled to the right of the brand name and similarly to the brand name they change color on any cursor hover as to indicate they are to be clicked. These links are responsive to screen size and collapse into a hamburger style icon on smaller screens, allowing for a cleaner feel to the screen. 
- The hero image is consistant accross all three pages. The image was chosen as it accuratly represents the gym for any visitors and hints towards the same colors used accross the rest of the page. This is to keep branding consistant for the user. 
- The footer located at the bottom of the screen lists all the business social media accounts and are linked to these pages. Again these links change color on a cursor hover like the nav bar as to keep the branding consistant accross the site. 

# Design 
The typography i chose is Hind Siliguri with sans-serif as a fall-back should the initial choice not load. I chose this as i felt it was a clean easy to read style for all users. I used this styling in different sizes with my headers as to keep brand consistancy. 

I chose the below color palette as i felt it best represented what the website offered. To me the palette gives the feel of a hardworking warehouse with the darker colors and a striking contrast with the aqua, a feeling of nightlife and motivation.

The imagery i used was found on [Unsplash](https://www.example.com). The hero image and about us image were chosen as they matched the aesthetic and color of the website whislt also representing what the gym actually looks like. The perosnal trainer images were used as customer friendly images of the trainers they can expect to meet and work with.
